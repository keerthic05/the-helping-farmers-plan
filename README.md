The Helping Farmers Project
=================




My Project
------------

Make a website with facts about the ongoing protests

Include a navigation bar with 4 pages (1-home page; 2-quiz one; 3-quiz two; 4-ways to help)

Objective: To inform people about the violent, problematic protests that are happening in India,
why this is happening, and how they can help 
  -the website tries to be informative in a fun way with interactive quizzes


Goals:
- two quizzes 
- have pictures and quiz-games to inform users on protest topic in a fun and interactive way.

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### ← index.html

The location of my home page (I will be creating more .html pages for the other pages of the website)

### ← style.css

CSS file adds styling to the home page 
since the two quizzes were imported using iframe tags, there css styling was finished on their own projects

### ← script.js

makes the quizzes interactive

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
