          The main problem that is stopping farmers from recieving the right amount of help. 
          Help is out of reach for many in India due to the lack of awareness of this problem.
          With the current political situation of America, most people are ignorant of the ongoing
          protests of farmers' fight for freedom. Even on social media, there aren't many posts about 
          how bad the situation is.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post">There are numerous ways to try and contribute to solving this complex conflict. 
          Currently, the problem is not as publicized as it should be. You can help by posting and reposting about the problem on 
          your social media. 
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post">
          Another thing you could do is sign petitions that refute the Farm Bills. 
          Make sure to share the link to these petitions on social media as well.
